# Turtle Pong Game
The Turtle Pong Game is a classic Pong arcade game implemented using the Turtle graphics library in Python. This two-player game simulates a virtual ping-pong match with paddles and a bouncing ball. Players control their respective paddles to hit the ball and prevent it from passing their side of the screen. The game features dynamic gameplay, real-time updating, and a scoreboard to track the players' scores.

# Features
Play a two-player Pong game with realistic paddle and ball movements.

Control the paddles using the arrow keys (Player 1) and 'W'/'S' keys (Player 2).

Bounce the ball off paddles and walls to score points.

Track player scores using an interactive scoreboard.

Enjoy smooth, real-time gameplay using the Turtle graphics library.

# Usage
1. Make sure you have Python installed. You can download it from the official Python website.

2. Ensure you have the required files (paddles.py, ball.py, scoreboard.py, center_line.py) in the same directory as your main script.

3. Open a new Python file or interactive environment.

4. Copy and paste the provided code into your Python environment.

5. Run the code. A window will appear displaying the Pong game environment.

6. Player 1 can use the arrow keys (Up and Down) to control their paddle.

7. Player 2 can use the 'W' key to move the paddle up and the 'S' key to move it down.

8. The ball bounces off paddles and walls. The goal is to prevent the ball from passing your side and to hit it towards your opponent's side to score points.

9. The game ends when you close the window.

# Customization
You can customize various aspects of the game to tailor it to your preferences:

Adjust the screen.setup() values to change the window size.

Modify colors, fonts, and positioning in the Scoreboard class to personalize the scoreboard's appearance.

Experiment with paddle and ball appearances and movements in the Paddle and Ball classes.
